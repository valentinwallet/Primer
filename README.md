## How to use it 

To use the Primer Checkout Coordinator you simply need to :

```swift
let _ = PrimerCheckoutBuilder
            .build()
            .start(from: presentingViewController)
```

That will build the `CheckoutCoordinator` and present it from the view you specified in `start(from:)` method.

### Customization

For more customization, about the pay button or payment methods, you can use the builder this way :

```swift
PrimerCheckoutBuilder
            .payButtonColor(.systemTeal) // Change pay button background color
            .payButtonTitleColor(.systemRed) // Change pay button title color
            .payButtonTitle("Pay with card") // Change pay button title
            .payButtonCornerRadius(16) // Change pay button corner radius
            .payButtonImage(UIImage(systemName: "creditcard")) // change pay button image
            .addPaymentMethod(.applePay(merchantId: "merchantId")) // add new payment method
            .build()
```

This customization leads us to this result :
